# Phase 4 Variable Tracker

Master sequence: the 44 admitted IDs in `docs/phase3-ai-evidence/closure/canonical_dataset.jsonl`, matched to `docs/phase3-ai-evidence/closure/variable_register.json` and sorted numerically by layer and variable number.

Neither closure file contains short names. Descriptions are copied from the matching entries in `docs/phase1-registry/Phase1-master-registry.md`; no conditional variables are added.

All rule, horizon, status and commit fields start blank for this walkthrough, including previously implemented variables. Record actual results only after the owner supplies the requested WSL output. Use `N/A` only for registry-excluded horizons. Record a real commit hash (linked to its GitHub commit) after commit/push confirmation; do not advance to the next task before both successful test output and that confirmation.

Walkthrough policy (owner instruction, 2026-08-31): allow stale observations with `STALE_DATA=True`; when a requested offset is unavailable, use the longest available own-series offset with `HORIZON_APPROX=True` and show the actual offset. Current scalars and panels/events receive an explicit documented anchor or primary-component rule during their task. Preserve existing quality flags and frozen Phase 3 evidence; make variable-local changes and keep unrelated worktree changes out of task commits.

Before any agent-run staging, commit or push, obtain the owner's confirmation. Until then this tracker records preparation only, not 44/44 completion.
